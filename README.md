# InvisiBox - Anonymous Workplace Communication Platform

InvisiBox is a privacy-first anonymous communication platform that bridges the gap between employees and management. It enables secure, two-way communication without requiring employees to create accounts or reveal their identities.

## üåü Key Features

- **Account-Free Employee Access**: Employees can participate without creating accounts or passwords
- **Anonymous Identity Protection**: Employees receive unique proxy email addresses that completely mask their real identity
- **Two-Way Communication**: Management can send messages and polls; employees can reply and participate anonymously
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant communication through email integration
- **Poll & Survey System**: Create polls and share results with employees
- **Subscriber Management**: Warn or ban problematic users while maintaining anonymity
- **Search Functionality**: Search messages and polls by title
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices

## üîß How It Works

### For Management:
1. **Account Creation**: Management creates an account and receives a company InvisiBox email (e.g., `company123@invisibox.email`)
2. **Employee Onboarding**: Share the company InvisiBox email with employees
3. **Dashboard Access**: Use the management dashboard to send messages, create polls, and manage subscribers
4. **Communication**: Send messages and polls to all subscribers, view responses anonymously

### For Employees:
1. **Subscription**: Subscribe using personal email + company InvisiBox email
2. **Anonymous Email**: Receive a unique proxy email (e.g., `emp9x83xxx@invisibox.email`)
3. **Communication**: Send messages and respond to polls using the proxy email
4. **Privacy**: Real identity remains completely hidden from management

## üìß Email Communication Flow

InvisiBox leverages **Postmark's Inbound Email** feature as the backbone of its communication system:

### Inbound Email Processing:
1. **Employee Sends Message**: Employee sends email from their proxy address to the company address
2. **Postmark Reception**: Postmark receives the email and forwards it to our webhook endpoint
3. **Backend Processing**: Our system processes the inbound email, extracts content, and stores the message
4. **Management Notification**: Message appears in the management dashboard instantly

### Outbound Email Delivery:
1. **Management Sends Message**: Management creates a message/poll through the dashboard
2. **Backend Processing**: System processes the message and prepares it for delivery
3. **Postmark Delivery**: Messages are sent to all subscriber proxy emails via Postmark
4. **Employee Reception**: Employees receive messages in their regular email inbox

### Email Proxy System:
- **Anonymous Routing**: All emails are routed through InvisiBox proxy addresses
- **Identity Protection**: Real employee emails are never exposed to management
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Messages flow seamlessly in both directions while maintaining anonymity
